# Translating.

Thank you for being interested in making Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition for Foundry VTT better! Below is a list of translations keys on existing files that still need translated, based on `en.json`. Feel free to create a new `*.json` file for a language that is not shown here!

The following translations have been abandoned **cn**, **cs**, [are you able to help?](./ABANDONED.md)
