## Disclaimer.

This system doesn’t include any materials from the books and you’ll have to enter manually, weapons, skills, items etc… to be able to play.
I’ve just provided some basics skills that you can use as example.
This system is completely Unofficial.

I’m testing my dev on Chrome. Not sure how or if it will behave on other browser.

## Usage.

Install in Foundry VTT from the Game Systems tab using the following manifest:  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HavlockV/CoC7-FoundryVTT/master/system.json`
