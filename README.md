# My (Unofficial) Call of Cthulhu implementation for Foundry VTT

My (Unofficial) implementation of the call of Cthulhu for foundry-vtt  

## Disclaimer

This system doesn’t include any materials from the books and you’ll have to enter manually, weapons, skills, items etc… to be able to play.
I’ve just provided some basics skills that you can use as example.
This system is completely Unofficial.

I’m testing my dev on Chrome. Not sure how or if it will behave on other browser.

## Installation/usage

Install in foundry VTT from the Game Systems tab using the following manifest :  
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HavlockV/CoC7-FoundryVTT/master/system.json>  

Compendium 'Examples' contains a 1920's character sheet, you just need to import it to start a character. Contains also a NPC and a creature example.  
Compendium 'Skills' contains a set of basic skills that you can use for your PC/NPC.  
Compendium 'Weapons' contains a single test weapon.
Compendium 'Roll Requests' contains numerous links for all your needs.
